**Definitions**

> Algorithm defines the steps for performing a task in a certain way.

> A good algorithm must have three features: correctness, maintainability, and efficiency.

**Big-0 5 rules**

1. f(N) times == O(f(N))
2. O(f(N)) theN O(g(N)) == O(f(N) + g(N))
3. if f(N) > g(N) == O(f(N))
4. O(f(N)) then for every step O(g(N)) == O(f(N) * g(N))
5. O(C x f(N)) == O(f(N))
